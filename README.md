# NLP Basics with NLTK

This is a small project where I explore some fundamental NLP tasks using the NLTK library.  
The goal was to get hands-on practice with text processing and see how different steps affect results.

## What's inside
- **Tokenization & Normalization**: splitting text into words and sentences, lowercasing, filtering, and stemming.  
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: tagging words with their grammatical roles and grouping tags into categories.  
- **N-Grams**: generating bigrams and trigrams, then checking which word pairs/triples are most common.  

## Data
I used a short descriptive passage about **Whistler, BC, Canada** as the text sample.

## Tech
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NLTK
