Whistler is a mountain town and resort in British Columbia, Canada, about two hours north of Vancouver. It sits in the Coast Mountains, in a valley surrounded by tall peaks, rivers, and lakes. The land has been home to the Squamish and Lil’wat First Nations for thousands of years, and both communities still have a presence in the area today. They used the valley and nearby mountains for hunting, fishing, and trading long before the first settlers arrived. The European settlers came much later, in the late 1800s, and the place began to develop as a small stop for trappers, prospectors, and travelers. In 1914, Alex and Myrtle Philip from Maine built Rainbow Lodge on Alta Lake, which became a well-known summer destination for fishing and holiday retreats. At the time the area was mostly wilderness, with only a few cabins and dirt trails.
The idea of Whistler as a ski destination came in the early 1960s, when a group of Vancouver businessmen wanted to create a world-class ski resort that could help Canada bid for the Winter Olympics. The mountain was then called London Mountain, but soon it was renamed Whistler Mountain after the whistling sound of the local marmot. Development moved quickly, and the ski hill officially opened in 1966 with a handful of lifts and a small base area. At the start it was a modest operation, but it grew as more visitors came, and over time new lifts and runs were added. In 1980, a rival mountain, Blackcomb, opened right next to Whistler. For years the two resorts competed against each other, each trying to offer more runs, better facilities, and new attractions. In the end, they merged, forming Whistler Blackcomb, which today is one of the largest and most famous ski resorts in North America.
The town itself also grew to support the resort. Whistler Village was built to give visitors a central place to stay, eat, and shop, and it was designed to be pedestrian-friendly, with paths instead of streets running through its core. Over the years the area expanded with more hotels, restaurants, and services, while still keeping the feel of a mountain town. The community is heavily tied to tourism, and most people who live there work in the ski industry, hospitality, or outdoor recreation. Life in Whistler changes with the seasons. In winter, the mountains draw skiers and snowboarders from all over the world, with trails ranging from easy beginner slopes to some of the toughest expert runs. In summer, the snow melts to reveal hiking trails, biking routes, and alpine lakes, making it just as popular for warm-weather activities.
A major turning point came in 2010, when Whistler hosted events for the Winter Olympics along with Vancouver. The alpine ski races, sliding sports, and many other competitions were held on Whistler and Blackcomb’s slopes, bringing global attention to the resort. The Games left behind a strong legacy in the form of new infrastructure, improved facilities, and even new neighborhoods. Another highlight of the modern resort is the Peak 2 Peak Gondola, which opened in 2008 and links Whistler and Blackcomb at high elevation. It is one of the longest and highest gondolas in the world and has become a landmark for visitors.
What makes Whistler stand out is not just the skiing, but the combination of natural beauty, outdoor activities, and a lively community. The mountains are rugged and scenic, the snowfall is heavy and reliable, and the range of activities keeps visitors coming year-round. At the same time, the history of the place, from its Indigenous roots to its Olympic role, adds to its character. While challenges like high housing costs and rapid growth remain, Whistler continues to be a unique place where nature, sport, and culture meet.
